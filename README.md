# PHP Tesseract-ocr Example
Example of batch image ocr using php and tesseract.

This is a very basic example of converting multiple images into OCR text file using the [Tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

1. The [Tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) needed to be pre-installed in the server/system.
2. The path variable needed to be set properly in the system/environment so that we can access the same from any directory. [Here is a good example video for windows](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Al5IcWk-NkJ9mCv-S59t2ZFan8AU).
3. [Tesseract Command line usage](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html).
